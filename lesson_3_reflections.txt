When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?


when i am colabarating my works with other worker who is staying in different city.




Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 

So, I can keep my local repository clean from changes done one my github repository by any outsider.




Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  
forks - related to github and copy of someone's else project 
clones - can be from github to local or local to local
branch - change in the single copy  





What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
 stored locally?

  
it will be helpful to know the state of the project.





How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

     



you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
