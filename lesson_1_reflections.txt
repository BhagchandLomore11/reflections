How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  

It narrow down the content I have to look for the changes made and I was easy for me to find the bug that I couldn't have find with whole text.  



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

 
My all work is saved. If i want to go back and look for older version it will be really easy for me to do it.   





What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?



The advantage of manually choosing has the advantage of logically thinking when a commit is important a avoid unwanted cluttering or loosing important changes 





Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 

sometimes files are interdependent and change in one affect other so it is important to save multiple files in single commit


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log - to see when you made specfic change and what change have you made

git diff - to compare one commit with the previous one or next one





How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?




if you break something while doing coding you can always go back and see when the code borke and make necessary changes



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?


I want to use git to manage my project while learning AI and Robotics
